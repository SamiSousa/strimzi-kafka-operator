= The downgrade process

Depending on the difference between the version being upgraded from and to, downgrade may, or may not always be possible.

Downgrading is always possible if the downgraded version of Kafka has the same log message format version as the upgraded version.
In this case, the Cluster Operator can perform the downgrade through a single rolling restart of the brokers.

If the downgraded version of Kafka has a different log message format version, then downgrade is only possible in running cluster has
_always_ had `log.message.format.version` set to the version used by the downgraded version. 
This is typically only the case if the upgrade procedure was aborted before the `log.message.format.version` was changed.
In this case, the downgrade will require two rolling restarts of the brokers if the interbroker protocol of the two versions is different, or a single rolling restart if they are the same.
